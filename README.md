# GUIs

This is a comparison of several GUI libraries and toolkits across several programming languages.

(Well, right now it's a place where I could eventually make such a comparison.)

Every example should use several different widget types, compile and run on Windows/Mac/Linux, and include some basic information to allow for some comparisons:
- screenshots
- lines of code
- distinct API calls
- launch time
- idle RAM usage
- executable size
