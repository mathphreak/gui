Made a Qt Quick Controls 2 Application with Qt Creator.
Style: Default.

Things that still don't work:
- The ListView is empty and I don't know why.
- Ideally the UI would pass along events to the actual C++ application rather than handling them internally. As such, this is an unrealistic example.

Qt Creator crash count: 2
